This library provides a number of PDF::Reader[0] based tools for use in testing
PDF output.  Presently, the primary purpose of this tool is to support the
tests found in Prawn[1], a pure Ruby PDF generation library.

However, it may be useful to others, so we have made it available as a gem in
its own right.
