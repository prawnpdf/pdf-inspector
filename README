PDF::Inspector : A tool for analyzing PDF output

This library provides a number of PDF::Reader[0] based tools for use in testing
PDF output.  Presently, the primary purpose of this tool is to support the
tests found in Prawn[1], a pure Ruby PDF generation library.

However, it may be useful to others, so we have made it available as a gem in
its own right.

= Installation

The recommended installation method is via Rubygems.

  gem install pdf-inspector

Or put this in your Gemfile, if you use Bundler[2]:

  group :test do
    gem 'pdf-inspector', :require => "pdf/inspector"
  end

= Licensing

Matzâ€™s terms for Ruby, GPLv2, or GPLv3. See LICENSE for details. 

= Mailing List

pdf-inspector is maintaiend as a dependency of prawn, the ruby PDF generation
library.

Any questions or feedback should be sent to the Prawn google group.

project. In 2010, Gregory officially handed the project off to the Prawn core
