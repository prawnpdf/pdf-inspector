# PDF::Inspector : A tool for analyzing PDF output

This library provides a number of PDF::Reader[0] based tools for use in testing
PDF output.  Presently, the primary purpose of this tool is to support the
tests found in Prawn[1], a pure Ruby PDF generation library.

However, it may be useful to others, so we have made it available as a gem in
its own right.

## Installation

The recommended installation method is via Rubygems.

```ruby
gem install pdf-inspector
```

Or put this in your Gemfile, if you use Bundler[2]:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'pdf-inspector', :require => "pdf/inspector"
end
```

## Usage

Check for text in the generated PDF:

```ruby
rendered_pdf = your_pdf_document.render
text_analysis = PDF::Inspector::Text.analyze(rendered_pdf)
text_analysis.strings.should include("foo")
```

or 

```ruby
text_analysis.full_text.index("foo").should_not be_nil
```

Note that `strings` is more like a list of words, and any string with a hyphen will be split up as two different
entries. `full_text` returns a string that approximates the full text of the document. 

Check number of pages

```
rendered_pdf = your_pdf_document.render
page_analysis = PDF::Inspector::Page.analyze(rendered_pdf)
page_analysis.pages.size.should == 2
```
