# PDF::Inspector: A tool for analyzing PDF output

![Maintained: yes](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained-yes-brightgreen.svg)
![Build status](https://github.com/prawnpdf/pdf-inspector/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

This library provides a number of [PDF::Reader][0] based tools for use in
testing PDF output.  Presently, the primary purpose of this tool is to support
the tests found in [Prawn][1], a pure Ruby PDF generation library.

However, it may be useful to others, so we have made it available as a gem in
its own right.

## Installation

The recommended installation method is via Rubygems.

```console
gem install pdf-inspector
```

Or put this in your Gemfile, if you use [Bundler][2]:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'pdf-inspector', require: "pdf/inspector"
end
```

## Usage

Check for text in the generated PDF:

```ruby
rendered_pdf = your_pdf_document.render
text_analysis = PDF::Inspector::Text.analyze(rendered_pdf)
text_analysis.strings # => ["foo"]
```

Note that `strings` returns an array containing one string for each text drawing
operation in the PDF. As a result, sentences and paragraphs will often be
returned in fragments. To test for the presence of a complete sentence or a
longer string, join the array together with an operation like `full_text =
text_analysis.strings.join(" ")`.

Check number of pages

```ruby
rendered_pdf = your_pdf_document.render
page_analysis = PDF::Inspector::Page.analyze(rendered_pdf)
page_analysis.pages.size # => 2
```
